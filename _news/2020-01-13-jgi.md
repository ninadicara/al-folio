Really excited to share that we have [won a seedcorn grant]((https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2020/01/13/jgi-seed-corn-funding-call-winners-2020-announced/)) from the Jean Golding Insitute for Data Intensive Science to pursue an idea about how we can infer wellbeing from music listening behaviours. 

Our project is called 'Mood music: using Spotify to infer wellbeing', and will focus on the development of an ecological momentary assessment system to collect data, ethics exploration with a focus group and a pilot study.
