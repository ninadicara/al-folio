I'm supervised by [Professor Claire Haworth](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/claire-m-a-haworth), [Dr Oliver Davis](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/oliver-s-davis) and [Professor Luke Sloan](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/38080-sloan-luke), based at the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/). My work is funded by a Data Science and AI PhD studentship from the [GW4 MRC BioMed DTP](https://www.gw4biomed.ac.uk/). Before I started my PhD I was a safeguarding social worker, working with children and families. 

My broad research interests are in `mental health`, `data science`, `data ethics` and `citizen science`. 

Alongside my PhD I co-organise [Data Ethics Club](https://very-good-science.github.io/data-ethics-club/index.html), which hosts fortnightly conversations about data ethics ([join us!](https://very-good-science.github.io/data-ethics-club/contents/get-involved.html)).
