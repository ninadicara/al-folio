Hello! I am Research Associate in Mental Health Data Science working with [Professor Claire Haworth](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/claire-m-a-haworth) and [Dr Oliver Davis](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/oliver-s-davis). My broad interests are in the `mental health of children and parents`, `data science`, `data ethics` and `citizen science`. 

I have recently finished my PhD working on understanding whether digital footprints are an effective way to track mental health.
I was supervised by [Professor Claire Haworth](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/claire-m-a-haworth), [Dr Oliver Davis](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/oliver-s-davis) and [Professor Luke Sloan](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/38080-sloan-luke), and based at the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/). My work was funded by a Data Science and AI PhD studentship from the [GW4 MRC BioMed DTP](https://www.gw4biomed.ac.uk/). Before I started my PhD I was a safeguarding social worker, working with children and families. 


Alongside my PhD I co-organise [Data Ethics Club](https://dataethicsclub.com/), which hosts fortnightly conversations about data ethics ([join us!](https://dataethicsclub.com/contents/join_in/join_in.html)).
